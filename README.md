# Machine_Learning_IRIS_Random_Forest
This repository has been made to showcase how to train and predict using IRIS dataset

I have done this poc in Databricks notebook and ADLS. The connection settings for ADLS is a part of cluster configuration, not shown here. It will be covered in some other repositories.
